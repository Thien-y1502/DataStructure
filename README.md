# DataStructure

**Submitted files include:**

- **PDFS Online Grid Traversal Code**  
    - The `grid_editor.py` file, when executed, will display a grid. When clicking:
        - 3 times marks the starting point  
        - 2 times marks an obstacle  
    - Note: This Python file runs in the terminal using:  
      ```bash
      python grid_editor.py
      ```
    - The `grid_matrix.txt` file contains the saved grid data generated by the Python script  
    - The C++ file implements the online traversal process using data from `grid_matrix.txt`  
    - Includes test cases, pseudocode files, and Excel sheets  

- **PDFS Offline Tree Traversal Code**  
    - The `PDFSFull2` file describes the PDFS offline traversal process on a tree  
    - The `PDFSFull1` file details the step-by-step PDFS offline traversal  
    - The `PDFS offline auto.html` file visually represents the traversal and path splitting  
      **Note: To run the HTML file, please download it first and open it locally in your browser.**  
    - The `TestCase` file contains test cases for `PDFSFull2` and the HTML file
    - Additionally, the file testCase.txt can be used to provide input data for testing the PDFSmr algorithm.
    - The PDFS_MR1Tree C++ code is located in the PDFS OFFLINE folder, while the separate html folder is used for visual illustration and presentation purposes
